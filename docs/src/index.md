# Couchzilla
 
Couchzilla â€“ CouchDB/Cloudant access for Julians.

## Philosophy

We've tried to wrap the CouchDB API as thinly as possible, hiding the JSON and the HTTP but no 
overwrought abstractions on top. That means that a CouchDB JSON document is represented as the 
corresponding de-serialisation into native Julia types:

    {
      "_id": "45c4affe6f40c7aaf0ba533f7a6601a2",
      "_rev": "1-47e8deed9ccfcf8d061f7721d3ba085c",
      "item": "Malus domestica",
      "prices": {
        "Fresh Mart": 1.59,
        "Price Max": 5.99,
        "Apples Express": 0.79
      }
    }

is represented as 

    Dict{UTF8String,Any}(
      "_rev"   => "1-47e8deed9ccfcf8d061f7721d3ba085c",
      "prices" => Dict{UTF8String,Any}("Fresh Mart"=>1.59,"Price Max"=>5.99,"Apples Express"=>0.79),
      "_id"    => "45c4affe6f40c7aaf0ba533f7a6601a2",
      "item"   => "Malus domestica"
    )

Along similar lines, Couchzilla will return CouchDB's JSON-responses simply converted as-is.

## Getting Started

Couchzilla defines two types, [`Client`](@ref) and [`Database`](@ref). `Client` represents an authenticated 
connection to the remote CouchDB _instance_. Using this you can perform database-level operations, 
such as creating, listing and deleting databases. The Database immutable type represents a client
that is connected to a specific database, allowing you to perform document-level operations.

Install the library using the normal Julia facilities `Pkg.add("Couchzilla")`.

Let's load up the credentials from environment variables.

```@example intro
using Couchzilla # hide
importall Couchzilla # hide
username = ENV["COUCH_USER"]
password = ENV["COUCH_PASS"]
host     = ENV["COUCH_HOST_URL"] # e.g. https://accountname.cloudant.com
nothing; # hide
```

We can now create a client connection, and use that to create a new database:

```@example intro
dbname = "mynewdb"
client = Client(username, password, host)
db, created = createdb(client; database=dbname)
nothing; # hide
```

If the database already existed, `created` will be set to `false` on return, and `true`
means that the database was created.

We can now add documents to the new database using [`createdoc`](@ref). It returns an array of 
`Dict`s showing the `{id, rev}` tuples of the new documents:

```@example intro
result = createdoc(db; data=[
    Dict("name" => "adam",    "data" => "hello"),
    Dict("name" => "billy",   "data" => "world"),
    Dict("name" => "cecilia", "data" => "authenticate"),
    Dict("name" => "davina",  "data" => "cloudant"),
    Dict("name" => "eric",    "data" => "blobbyblobbyblobby")
])
```

This form of [`createdoc`](@ref) creates multiple documents using a single `HTTP POST` which is 
the most efficient way of creating multiple new documents.

We can read a document back using [`readdoc`](@ref), hitting the CouchDB primary index. Note that 
reading back a document you just created is normally bad practice, as it will sooner or 
later fall foul of CouchDB's [eventual consistency](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/consistency.html) 
and give rise to sporadic, hard to troubleshoot errors. Having said that, let's do it 
anyway, and hope for the best:

```@example intro
id = result[2]["id"]
readdoc(db, id)
```

returning the winning revision for the given `id` as a `Dict`.

[Conflict handling](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/conflicts.html) in CouchDB and eventual 
consistency is beyond the scope of this documentation, but worth understanding fully before using 
CouchDB in anger.

## Query

`Mango` (also known as [Cloudant Query](https://docs.cloudant.com/cloudant_query.html)) is 
a declarative query language inspired by [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/). It allows
us to query the database in a (slightly) more ad-hoc fashion than using map reduce views.

In order to use this feature we first need to set up the necessary indexes:

```@example intro
mango_index(db, ["name", "data"])
```

We can now use this index to retrieve data:

```@example intro
mango_query(db, q"name=davina")
```
 
The construct `q"..."` (see [`@q_str`](@ref)) is a custom string literal type which takes a simplistic DSL 
expression which gets converted to the actual JSON-representation of a Mango selector.
If you are familiar with [Mango selectors](https://docs.cloudant.com/cloudant_query.html#selector-syntax), 
you can use the raw JSON expression if you prefer:

```@example intro
mango_query(db, Selector("{\"name\":{\"\$eq\":\"davina\"}}"))
```

There are also coroutine versions of some of the functions that return data
from views. If we had many results to process, we could use [`paged_mango_query`](@ref)
in a Julia Task:

    for page in @task paged_mango_query(db, q"name=davina"; pagesize=10)
        # Do something with the page.docs array
    end

This version uses the `limit` and `skip` parameters and issues an HTTP(S) request
per page.

## Views

A powerful feature of CouchDB are [secondary indexes](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/couchapp/views/intro.html), 
known as [views](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/views.html). They are created using 
a map function written most commonly in Javascript, and optionally a reduce part. For 
example, to create a view on the `name` field, we use the following:

```@example intro
view_index(db, "my_ddoc", "my_view", 
"""
function(doc) {
  if(doc && doc.name) {
    emit(doc.name, 1);
  }
}""")
```

To read from this view, use the [`view_query`](@ref) method:

```@example intro
view_query(db, "my_ddoc", "my_view"; keys=["davina", "billy"])
```

## Using attachments

CouchDB can store files alongside documents as attachments. This can be a convenient feature
for many applications, but it has drawbacks, especially in terms of performance. If you find
that you need to store large (say greater than a couple of meg) binary attachments, you should
probably consider a dedicated, separate file store and only use CouchDB for metadata.

To write an attachment, use [`put_attachment`](@ref), which expects an `{id, rev}` tuple referencing
and existing document in the database and the path to the file holding the attachment:

    data = createdoc(db, Dict("item" => "screenshot"))
    result = put_attachment(db, data["id"], data["rev"], "test.png", "image/png", "data/test.png")

In order to read the attachment, use [`get_attachment`](@ref), which returns an IO stream:

    att = get_attachment(db, result["id"], "test.png"; rev=result["rev"])
    open("data/fetched.png", "w") do f
      write(f, att)
    end

## Geospatial queries

One of the fancier aspects of Cloudant is its geospatial capabilities, and Couchzilla
provides access to this functionality. Using this it is possible to use Cloudant to 
answer questions such as "show me all documents that fall within a given radius of a
given point". A full description of this capability is beyond the scope of this 
document, but Cloudant provides rich documentation on the [subject](https://docs.cloudant.com/geo.html).

In order to try out the geospatial stuff using Couchzilla, we first need some data. 
Cloudant provides an open database that you can replicate into your own account 
[here](https://education.cloudant.com/crimes). It's a database of the locations of 
reported crimes in the Boston area.

Let's connect Couchzilla to a replica of this database, and run through the examples
from Cloudant's geospatial tutorial [page](https://cloudant.com/using-cloudant-geospatial-tutorial/). 
We can re-use the client from before:

```@example intro
geodb = connectdb(client; database="crimes")
nothing; # hide
```

The database already contains the necessary geospatial indexes. Had this not been the case
we could have indexed it using [`geo_index`](@ref).

So let's list the first 20 crimes within a radius of 10,000m of the Boston State House:

```@example intro
result = geo_query(geodb, "geodd", "geoidx";
  lat    = 42.357963,
  lon    = -71.063991,
  radius = 10000.0,
  limit  = 200)
result["rows"]
```

We can specify a polygon for the Commercial Street corridor, which should yield only two docs:

```@example intro
result = geo_query(geodb, "geodd", "geoidx";
  g="POLYGON ((-71.0537124 42.3681995 0,-71.054399 42.3675178 0,-71.0522962 42.3667409 0,-71.051631 42.3659324 0,-71.051631 42.3621431 0,-71.0502148 42.3618577 0,-71.0505152 42.3660275 0,-71.0511589 42.3670263 0,-71.0537124 42.3681995 0))")
result["rows"]
```

If you want to delete a database, simply call [`deletedb`](@ref):

```@example intro
deletedb(client, dbname)
```

## Cloudant-specific extensions

Cloudant pushes most of its stuff to upstream to [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). However, not everything Cloudant does makes sense for CouchDB, and once such example is throughput throttling. Cloudant, currently only in its Bluemix guise, prices its service in terms of provisioned throughput capacity for lookups, writes and queries. This means that you purchase a certain max number of requests per second, bucketed by type. This is similar in spirit to how other purveyors of database services price their services (e.g. [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/)). 

When you hit capacity, Cloudant will return an error, signified by the HTTP status code 429 (`Too many requests`). This means that the request was not successful, and will need to be retried at a later stage. Couchzilla optionally gives you a way to deal with 429 errors:

    retry_settings!(;enabled=true, max_retries=5, delay_ms=10)

This will enable the retrying of requests failed with a 429. This will try a request a maximum of 5 times, with a delay of 10 ms added cumulatively, plus a little bit of noise (randomly between 1 and 10 ms). This is a module-global setting, so will apply to all `Client`s created within the same `Julia` session.

You can retrieve the current settings using:

    retry_settings()

Note that this behaviour is not enabled by default, and relying on it alone on a rate-capped cluster will only help with temporary transgressions â€“ your own code must still handle the case where the max retries are exceeded.

## Client

```@docs
Couchzilla.Client
Couchzilla.connectdb(client::Client; database::AbstractString=nothing)
Couchzilla.createdb(client::Client; database::AbstractString=nothing)
Couchzilla.dbinfo(client::Client, name::AbstractString)
Couchzilla.listdbs(client::Client)
Couchzilla.deletedb(client::Client, name::AbstractString)
Couchzilla.cookieauth!
```

## Database

The Database type represents a client connection tied to a specific database name. This is 
immutable, meaning that if you need to talk to several databases you need to create one Database
type for each.

```@docs
Couchzilla.Database
Couchzilla.bulkdocs(db::Database; data=[], options=Dict())
Couchzilla.createdoc(db::Database, body=Dict())
Couchzilla.createdoc(db::Database; data=[Dict()])
Couchzilla.readdoc(db::Database,id::AbstractString;rev="",attachments=false,att_encoding_info=false,atts_since=[],conflicts= false,deleted_conflicts=false,latest=false,meta=false,open_revs=[],revs=false,revs_info=false)
Couchzilla.updatedoc(db::Database; id::AbstractString=nothing, rev::AbstractString=nothing, body=Dict())
Couchzilla.deletedoc(db::Database; id::AbstractString=nothing, rev::AbstractString=nothing)
```

## Views
```@docs
Couchzilla.view_index(db::Database, ddoc::AbstractString, name::AbstractString, map::AbstractString; reduce::AbstractString = "")
Couchzilla.view_query
Couchzilla.alldocs
```

## Mango/Cloudant Query
```@docs
Couchzilla.Selector
Couchzilla.Selector()
Couchzilla.Selector(raw_json::AbstractString)
Couchzilla.isempty
Couchzilla.@q_str
Couchzilla.QueryResult
Couchzilla.mango_query
Couchzilla.paged_mango_query
Couchzilla.mango_index
Couchzilla.listindexes(db::Database)
Couchzilla.mango_deleteindex(db::Database; ddoc="", name="", indextype="")
```

## Attachments

You can attach files to documents in CouchDB. This can occasionally be convenient,
but using attachments has performance implications, especially when combined with 
replication. See Cloudant's [docs](https://docs.cloudant.com/attachments.html) on 
the subject.

```@docs
Couchzilla.put_attachment(db::Database, id::AbstractString, rev::AbstractString, name::AbstractString, mimetype::AbstractString, file::AbstractString)
Couchzilla.get_attachment(db::Database, id::AbstractString, name::AbstractString; rev::AbstractString = "")
Couchzilla.delete_attachment(db::Database, id::AbstractString, rev::AbstractString, name::AbstractString)
```

## Replication

Unlike e.g. [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), [CDTDatastore](https://github.com/cloudant/CDTDatastore) 
and [sync-android](https://github.com/cloudant/sync-android), `Couchzilla` is not a replication library 
in that it does not implement a local data store. However, you have access to all replication-related
endpoints provided by CouchDB. The CouchDB replication algorithm is largely undocumented, but a good
[write-up](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios/wiki/Replication-Algorithm) can be found 
in Couchbase's repo.
